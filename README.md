#UDACITY PROJECT 5 (CAPSTONE): TRAVEL PLANNER APP

##Project Description

This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. Given that this is the Capstone project, it's highly encouraged for you to go above and beyond, adding additional functionality and customization to truly stand out with a project you are proud to have at the top of your portfolio!

##Project Requirements

*Utilize webpack
*Pull lat and long data from GEONAMES API
*Pull picture of selected city for background of entry
*Pull weather data for selected city on selected dates
*Display countdown until trips
*Utilize Jest for unit testing
*Implement service workers
*Refactor code

##Extra Features Added (Listed in Ruberic)

*Add end date and display length of trip.
*Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
*Allow the user to remove the trip.
*Incorporate icons into forecast.
*Allow the user to add additional trips (this may take some heavy reworking, but is worth the challenge).

##Extra Features Added (Not listed in Ruberic)

*Added calendar inputs for start and end date
*Added min dates to calendar inputs for that you cannot select historical date and you cannot select an end date before the start date
*Use server to save the data so that when the server is running, the previously saved entries will be added to the page when reloaded.
*Added dropdown for Country, state/providence, city to prevent bad inputs
